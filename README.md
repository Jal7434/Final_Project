<h2> Introduction </h2>
This project should allow users to go throuhg large amounts of data from Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource or POWER and access specified and general data about worldwide meterological and radiation data. The project uses dynamically updated monthly data which contains mmeteorological data and radiation data about the world.

<h2> Important Information Before starting use of code </h2> 
To begin two files will need to be downloaded which can be found <a href="https://opendap.larc.nasa.gov/opendap/POWER/monthly/contents.html">here</a> or can be downloaded to one's terminal by using the <code>wget</code> command

```
wget https://opendap.larc.nasa.gov/opendap/POWER/monthly/power_901_monthly_meteorology_utc.nc.covjson  
```

and 

```
wget https://opendap.larc.nasa.gov/opendap/POWER/monthly/power_901_monthly_radiation_utc.nc.covjson
